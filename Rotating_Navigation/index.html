                Millonarios Fútbol Club is a professional Colombian football team based in Bogotá, that currently plays in the Categoría Primera A. They play their home games at the El Campín stadium.

                Millonarios, was initially created in 1937 by students from the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé. After the team initially was unsure about which name it would want to use: Unión and Juventud were originally favoured, it got under the influence of the city administration of Bogotá and operated as Club Municipal de Deportes. Millonarios was formally founded on June 18, 1946, thanks to the efforts of Alfonso Senior Quevedo, who became the first chairman.

                Considered to be one of the strongest clubs from Colombia, it is one of the most consistent clubs in the country. Millonarios has won 15 league titles, 3 Copa Colombia and a Superliga Colombiana, making it the second most successful team in Colombia. They have also been crowned continental champions by winning the Copa Simón Bolívar in 1972 and the Copa Merconorte in 2001. In addition, Millonarios managed to obtain the Small Club World Cup in 1953, a title of great importance and relevance for the time.

                Millonarios is also one of only three teams that have played every first division tournament in the country, along with their traditional rivals Santa Fe and Atlético Nacional.

                In the early 1950s, Millonarios formed a team called the Ballet Azul, which was considered by several South American and European specialists as the best team in the world. It has been included in lists about the best football clubs of the world of all time elaborated by important international sports media, being the only Colombian team present in them. It is also ranked as the fourth best Colombian club of the 20th century and as the ninth best Colombian club so far in the 21st century. Millonarios is also credited as the third best Colombian team in the CONMEBOL club tournaments and ranks 51st in the official club ranking of the Copa Libertadores.

            <p>Millonarios greatly benefited from a major players' strike in the Argentinian league in 1948, which caused a great diaspora of players towards Colombia. The most successful period for the club was during the early 1950s due to the notable Argentinean presence. During this period with the squad that was known as The Blue Ballet, that featured great players such as Alfredo di Stefano, Adolfo Pedernera, Néstor Rossi, Julio Cozzi, Antonio "Maestrico" Báez, Hugo Reyes, Reinaldo Mourin and other figures in Argentina, mainly from River Plate. Thanks to the great football that showed these players on the field, Millonarios was named by several media outlets in South America and Europe, as the best team in the world in the early 1950s.

            In 1951, Colombia was suspended by FIFA due to the recruitment of international players without a pass; the teams were forced to return all expatriate players that had participated in the tournament through irregular means. This edict marked the departure of di Stefano in February 1953, receiving bids from Barcelona and Real Madrid, who came to win the bid for the player. The Colombian national team was also banned from the 1954 FIFA World Cup for the same reason.</p>
